# How to Use the Dashboard

1. Download the SimpleJazz.py and JazzStandards.json files, and make sure to install streamlit on your machine.

How to install streamlit: https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation

2. Open your terminal or command prompt, then navigate to the directory where SimpleJazz.py is installed. Make sure JazzStandards.json is also in this directory.
   
3. Run 'streamlit run your_file_name.py' to open the dashboard!

# GenreClassifier.py

GenreClassifier.py is an LSTM model able to predict the 'genre' or rhythm of a jazz standard (bossa, swing, ballad, etc) based on its chords. In future updates, this will be incorporated into SimpleJazz.
